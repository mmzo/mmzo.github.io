Before I start the job, I get to work.

I want my passion for analytics, data, and IT to be my job.

I work hard at whatever I do, but analytics is my passion

A quote - something inspirational. E.g "There are two times when it's best 
to start something new: twenty years ago and today."

Passionate about analytics 

Life's too short not to do what you love.

I've been a student, a teacher, a barista, a musician, a manager, 
a writer and an editor. Now I want to be an analyst.

Data analysis is my passion.

Learning is like a muscle -- you have to feed it for it to grow. And I'm 
always hungry.

I am hungry to know more about data analysis, that's why every day 
before work I am feeding my desire to know more by learning about the 
latest techniques and methods in the field.

--> As for many, Covid-19 was rock bottom. I made it my turning point.

Covid-19 led me to reevaluate my career decisions. Now I am working on
my passion: data analytics. I am constantly curious and dedicate my time
to learning new skills for analysis and visualisation. I can obtain, prepare,
clean, analyse and communicate data in a way that is transparent and 
easy to understand. Read on below to find out how I've been making the transition.

For many people, Covid-19 was a massive low point. For me, it's 
when I started to turn things around.

Before I start the job, I get to work.

I want my passion for analytics, data, and IT to be my job.

I work hard at whatever I do, but analytics is my passion

Passionate about analytics 

Life's too short not to do what you love.

I've been a student, a teacher, a barista, a musician, a manager, 
a writer and an editor. Now I want to be an analyst.

Data analysis is my passion.

Learning is like a muscle -- you have to feed it for it to grow. And I'm 
always hungry.

I am hungry to know more about data analysis, that's why every day 
before work I am feeding my desire to know more by learning about the 
latest techniques and methods in the field.

<p>2020 was a year for soul-searching for many people, for obvious reasons: 
The way many did business or conducted work had been turned completely on 
its head. Many were increasingly working from home and, for those of us who
were in service industries,  our faces were coverd the entire day with masks. 
Fist bumps had replaced handshakes, hugs were frowned upon, we all became 
experts in reading eyebrow signals. It wasn't a great time.</p>

<p>I work both in education as a lecturer and in hospitality as a cafe manager,
so you can bet I felt this impact pretty strongly. I'm not going to lie - I
 was mentally exhausted and needed a change.</p>

<p>About this time, a friend who I've known for forever
contacted me asking if I was interested in making an app with them to 
track Covid cases. I had done some coding at university, mostly GIS-related 
spatial analysis stuff in R and Python but had never built anything before, 
so I agreed. Very quickly I became infatuated with the world of programming 
and frustrated by my lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>Our first app, Febris, was a basic data visualisor of the covid numbers 
across the world. My contribution was fairly minimal, but the process 
helped me realise that my interests lay in the data. <i>For some strange reason</i>, 
I liked working with databases, I enjoyed examining the data itself, thinking 
about its potential applications. I wondered what insights it could lead to 
and was willing to face the brain-deadening, mind-numbing frustation of 
creating a well-composed Viz when you don't know the shortcuts or have 
an established process.</p>

<p> Outside of my full time job, I began to learn more about data analysis. 
I took courses in Business Analytics, SQL, Tableau, R and R-Studio. 
On Kaggle, I brushed up on the basics of machine learning and, most 
recently, I have completed the Google Data Analytics Specialisation 
on Coursera.</p>

<p>I am <i>deeply</i> interested in this field and dedicate my spare time to learning
as much on the topic as I can. This site is a demonstration of this interest and a 
record of what I've learned so far. I am planning here to explore my other interests in 
sustainability,tourism, hospitality, and education, so I hope you enjoy browsing 
through an interesting collection of projects.</p>

<p>Now, if you've made it through all of that, I salute you. If you're a potential
employer, feel free to take a look at my CV, below. If you're a fellow data 
enthusiast or potential collaborator, drop me a line by clicking on the contact

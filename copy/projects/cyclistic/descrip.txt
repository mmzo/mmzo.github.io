In this project I analysed data from a fictional Chicago-based bike rental company
for the past 13 months. The project was from the perspective of the data analytics team, 
who are seeking to assist the marketing team to improve membership uptake. The task of the 
data analytics team is primarily to explore the current data and uncovering differences 
between member and casual users.
